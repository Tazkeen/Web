        <h2>What our Customers Say</h2>

        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"Visited on a weekday to get some of their sausages and burger patties. It was not very busy like it is on a weekend so no long lines, good friendly service, butchery is small but has tons on offer. The sausages and patties were very nice, tried the dhanya, dhanya BBQ and the chilli. The chilli option is not very hot. They have a tray with bottles of pickle/atchar on the counter, please don't buy this, I bought a bottle of vegetable atchar and it is horrible, I think it may be off/old. Overall the meat products and service was good, just the atchar that put me off. I will be back for the patties but will avoid any of the condiments offered there."</p>
